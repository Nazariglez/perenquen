        All the actors are painted in the same order they were created,
        but we can alter this order with "depth" property.

        You can enable this feature in the game config before create the renderer to be used internally,
        but it's a expensive feature if you had many actors, or you are continuously creating new actors.

        So, with another way it would be used just when you want it, to sort only the containers what you want.
